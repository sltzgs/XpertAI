## About
 
Welcome to XpertAI. We think of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) as crucial for an informed application of machine learning methods in practice. 

Here, we soon present the supplementary code presented in our paper ["XpertAI: uncovering regression model strategies for sub-manifolds"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07486), which has been accepted to the 3rd World Conference on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (09-11 July, 2025 - Istanbul, Turkey).
